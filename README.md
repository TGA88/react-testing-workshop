# Nextjsapp-Boilerplate example

this template is inteded to use for creating new project that is included jest , react-testing-libary , redux-toolkit.
I have configured for jest and redux-toolkit. So you can start writting the test and to be able to use redux. 

## How to use

After clone the repo then run command below

```bash
npm install 
```

### For Testing
you just only create test file with extionsion as .test.js or spec.js in the same place of your component or in folder \__test__ .
